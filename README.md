### Considerations

- I have the React Native Ready project
- I used React Native cli to create the app. I had many issues with expo in the past, and I have already an environment set with IOS and Android
- I was creating in layers, so first make sure the front-end add, edit items on a list and then I added a storage layer
- I decided to follow with Typescript and to use native components instead to use a UI Library
